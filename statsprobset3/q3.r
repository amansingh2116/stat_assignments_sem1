#tangent at (a,b) will have equation ax+by=1, so for y=0 we have x as 1/a where (a,b)~(cos(p),sin(p)) so x-intercept of tangent at the point for a given angle is 1/cos(p)

#thus we found the U(that is qa) and L(that is qb) such that X lies between them with 90% probability and U-L(that is minc) being minimum , and it vary everytime we take different observations
#also we found the probability that X exceeds 5 (prob5) which is approximately 0.06%
